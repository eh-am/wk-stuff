That's why this verb is \u003cvocabulary\u003eto roll something\u003c/vocabulary\u003e.\r\n\r\nThis is a transitive verb. That means you roll something else, like a ball. Or, if you're a dung beetle, poop. 💩 Not to be confused with \u003cja\u003e転がる\u003c/ja\u003e, which is intransitive, like so many verbs ending in \u003cja\u003eがる\u003c/ja\u003e.","reading_mnemonic":"You learned this reading when you learned \u003cja\u003e転がる\u003c/ja\u003e, but here's a mnemonic anyway just in case:\r\n\r\nWhen you try \u003cvocabulary\u003eto roll something\u003c/vocabulary\u003e, the outside bits may be moving, but its \u003creading\u003ecore\u003c/reading\u003e (\u003cja\u003eころ\u003c/ja\u003e) stays still.
