Four is too high a number to count without falling asleep.\r\n\r\nBy the way! Both the reading \u003cja\u003eよん\u003c/ja\u003e and \u003cja\u003eし\u003c/ja\u003e are pretty common, but because the on'yomi reading \u003cja\u003eし\u003c/ja\u003e sounds just like the word for \"death,\" it isn't used as much. Generally when you're just counting (for example, \"1, 2, 3, 4...\"), you will use the reading \u003cja\u003eし\u003c/ja\u003e. But when you are counting things or people, you'll use \u003cja\u003eよん\u003c/ja\u003e.

That means they share meanings as well. \r\n\r\nDon't confuse this with \u003cja\u003e〜間\u003c/ja\u003e which is similar in meaning but different in reading. The \u003cja\u003e〜間\u003c/ja\u003e means it's attached to something. This is a standalone word.","reading_mnemonic":"Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it uses the kun'yomi reading. \u003cja\u003e間\u003c/ja\u003e has two common kun'yomi readings, \u003cja\u003eあいだ\u003c/ja\u003e and \u003cja\u003eま\u003c/ja\u003e. You haven't learned these readings yet, so here's an explanation of each reading and mnemonics to help you remember them: \r\n\r\nWhen \u003cja\u003e間\u003c/ja\u003e refers to a longer interval of time, it's generally read as \u003cja\u003eあいだ\u003c/ja\u003e. For a short burst of time, it's read as \u003cja\u003eま\u003c/ja\u003e. When it means an interval of space, it's usually read as \u003cja\u003eあいだ\u003c/ja\u003e. \r\n\r\nYou can remember this because time feels longer in \u003creading\u003eIda\u003c/reading\u003eho (\u003cja\u003eあいだ\u003c/ja\u003e). Any interval of time you spend there feels so long, because Idaho life moves so slowly. As soon as you cross the border and enter a new state, you call your \u003creading\u003ema\u003c/reading\u003e (\u003cja\u003eま\u003c/ja\u003e) to tell her you're finally out of that slooooow state, and the intervals of time feel shorter.
